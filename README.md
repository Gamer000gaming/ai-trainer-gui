# AI trainer GUI
A very cool and easy to use Python program that helps you train AIs on games. It is 100% GUI and very beginner-friendly.
## Features
- Train an AI on almost any Gymnasium env
- See the training ETA and percentage
- Generate a GIF that show the AI playing the game

## Planned features
- A button to pause the training, see the AI playing in its current state, and continue training
- A button to launch a random player (a player that plays random things)

## Step-by-step guide
- Launch the program.
- Enter the name of the environment and click "Load env". The CartPole env is good for testing. To see a list of environments, go read the [Gymnasium Documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)
- Enter the amount of training frames. 10000 is very good for CartPole, it will be fast.
- Click "Train" to start training the AI.
- When training is finished, click "Save model" to save your AI.
- To generate a GIF, enter the number of frames you want the GIF to have, and click "Make GIF". The GUI will freeze for a moment, don't close it. When it is finished, you will have a GIF of your AI playing the game!
- If you want to re-generate a GIF for a previously trained model, load **the same environment as the one used to train the AI** and load the model using the "Load model" button. Click "Make GIF", the GUI will freeze and your GIF will be generated.
